\title{The Martian Surface}
\subtitle{Composition, Mineralogy and Physical Properties}

\noindent Phenomenal new observations from Earth-based telescopes and Mars-based orbiters, landers, and rovers have dramatically advanced our understanding of the past environments on Mars. These include the first global-scale infrared and reflectance spectroscopic maps of the surface, leading to the discovery of key minerals indicative of specific past climate conditions; the discovery of large reservoirs of subsurface water ice; and the detailed in situ roving investigations of three new landing sites, which gives us firm evidence for the presence of liquid water on the surface or in the shallow subsurface in the distant past.

This important, comprehensive book provides an overview of the latest Mars compositional and mineralogic discoveries since the last major review of this topic was published in 1992. It is an essential resource for researchers and students in planetary science, astronomy, space exploration, planetary geology, and planetary geochemistry. Specialized terms are defined throughout, so the material will be easily understood by researchers just getting into this field.\vskip\baselineskip
